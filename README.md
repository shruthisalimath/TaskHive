# TaskHive - Project Management

## Description
Task Hive is a project management application that allows users to create projects and tasks to help track their work. The application allows users to perform various operations such as adding, updating, and removing projects and tasks. Working on Task Hive allowed us to gain valuable experience with react and setting up a mongo database. Utilizing graphQL allowed us to create a more efficient application by only querying the data we needed. Using a new technology like dnd-kit allowed us to create a more user friendly application by allowing users to drag and drop items.
