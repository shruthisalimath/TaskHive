// See week 21 Mern activity 19 for React Router/

// a single project is passed into this component from the ProjectList component
// test project id = 64cc5b703b048340f8be464b

// the project is destructured into its id, name property, tasks property

// the _id is used to create a link to the single project page
// the name is displayed as the title of the project

// the tasks property is an array of tasks associated with the project
   // each task in the array has a status property that is either "toDo", "inProgress", or "completed"
   // tasks are displayed in columns based on their status
   // the tasks are displayed as cards
    // each card has a header with the name of the task and an edit button

// the description is displayed as the description of the project

// the deleteProject function is called when the delete button is clicked

// There are 3 columns: toDo, inProgress, and completed
// each column has a header with the name of the column
// each column has a button to add a task to the column
// each column has at least one card, if there are no tasks, the first card will display "No tasks yet" or just an add task button

// each card has a header with the name of the task and an edit button
// The card is a form that allows the user to edit the task name, if the user wants to edit more than just the name, the edit button will take the user to a new page or open a modal.

// each card has drag and drop functionality that allows the user to move the card to another column
// each card has a delete button that calls the deleteTask function when clicked
